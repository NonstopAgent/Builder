# Contributing

Thanks for helping! To contribute:
- Create an issue to propose large changes.
- Create a branch named like: reorg/<short-description> or feat/<short-description>.
- Run existing linters and tests locally before opening a PR.
- Keep PRs small and focused (one behavioral change per PR).
- CI will run a basic linter and tests (we'll add this in a follow-up PR).

If you're reorganizing files, prefer moves (git mv) so history is preserved.
